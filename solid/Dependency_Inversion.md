## What is the Dependency Inversion Principle?

The **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** is the fifth and final principle in the SOLID design principles.

* DIP states:
  * **"High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions."**
  * **"Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions."**
* This principle encourages designing systems that depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.

Key concepts of DIP:

* **Inversion of control**: Traditional dependency relationships are "inverted" or reversed
* **Abstraction dependency**: Both high and low-level components depend on abstractions
* **Ownership inversion**: High-level modules "own" the abstraction interfaces that low-level modules implement
* **Decoupling**: High and low-level modules are decoupled through interfaces

Benefits of applying DIP:

* **Flexibility**: Systems can easily switch between different implementations
* **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation with mock implementations
* **Modularity**: Systems become more modular with clearly defined boundaries
* **Maintainability**: Changes to one component have minimal impact on others

Common implementation patterns for DIP:

* **Dependency injection**: Dependencies are provided to objects rather than created internally
* **Factory pattern**: Objects are created through factory interfaces
* **Service locator**: Components retrieve their dependencies from a central registry

DIP is often considered the most important SOLID principle because it enables true modularity and flexibility in software systems.
